## OPE Server - Self Hosted Canvas

Welcome to the OPE Server page. Here you will find resources on how to run the system to stand up or support your self hosted prison ready Canvas LMS system.

### What is the OPE (Open Prison Education) System

The system is designed to make it easy to deploy and update a self hosted canvas system in limited (e.g. "offline"/Prison) environments. The goal is to extend access to modern tools to those who have thus far been denied access. We aim to provide equity in learning materials in an environment that makes that difficult.
