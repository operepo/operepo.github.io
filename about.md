# Abstract
Corrections facilities have major logistical hurdles in trying to deliver modern education and classroom resources to incarcerated students. The goal of this project is to build education oriented technical infrastructure that is easy to deploy in offline and hybrid network environments. Greatly increased access to computing resources and educational materials will allow education to scale effectively even in prison constrained environments.
